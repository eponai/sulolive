(defn transact-route!
  "Warning: Probably not what you want to use. See: (set-route!) instead.

  Set's the app route given either a reconciler or a component, and a route.
   Also optinally takes
   :route-params - a map with route specific parameters.
   :queue? - re-renders from the root component, defaults to true
   :tx - an additional transaction to be transacted after the route has been set.
         Can be a mutation, a read-key or a vector of those things.

   Examples:
   - Set route to be a store:
     (set-route! this :store {:route-params {:store-id 12345}})
   - Set route to index and re-read :cart/price
     (set-route! this :index {:tx :cart/price})
     (set-route! this :index {:tx [:cart/price]})

   Heavily inspired by compassus/set-route! (github.com/compassus/compassus),
   which we doesn't use because it's too frameworky (We'd have to use its parser
   for example, and I'm not sure it works with datascript(?))."
